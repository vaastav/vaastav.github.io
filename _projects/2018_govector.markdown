A Vector clock logging library in Go which implements the vector clock algorithm and provides feature-rich logging and encoding 
infrastructure. This library can be added to a Go project to generate a
<a href="http://bestchai.bitbucket.io/shiviz/">ShiViz</a>-compatible vector-clock timestamped log of events in a concurrent or distributed system. This library can also generate <a href="https://bestchai.bitbucket.io/tsviz/">TSViz</a>-compatible logs
I have been the maintainer of the library since June 2018.
