<h4> Software Engineering Intern, May 2017 - Aug 2017 </h4>

<ul>
<li> Intern with the Modular Diagnostics (MODS) Team</li>
<li> Implemented memory repair sequences as scripts to repair bad parts of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). This resulted in increasing GPU yield.</li>
<li> Designed, developed and implemented a CUDA based linpack test to stress every bit of memory to weed out GPUs with bad memory in the early stages of production.</li>
<li> Designed and deployed an internal website that reported every release version of the MODS application, the last change in the release and a link to download the release.</li>
<li> Ported CUDA threading stress tests from CUDA teams to MODS.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Software Engineering Intern, May 2016 - Aug 2016 </h4>

<ul>
<li> Intern with the Modular Diagnostics (MODS) Team</li>
<li> Implemented a synchronization option for CUDA based linpack stress tests in MODS to synchronize CUDA kernel launches within 30µs across multiple GPUs in multi-GPU systems like DGX systems.</li>
<li> Ported MODS code and windows builds to msvc140 from msvc90 to enable C++11.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Software Developer Intern, Sep 2015 - Apr 2016 </h4>

<ul>

<li> Intern with the Sequoia team</li>
<li> Designed, developed and implemented the frontend and backend of the 3D PDF export option in Sequoia which allowed users to export their 3D models in PDF files by implementing a writer class for the U3D file format. </li>
<li> Implemented import options for Lidar point cloud file formats of scanners from Riegl and Zoller + Fröhlich.</li>
<li> Implemented binary string obfuscation making the licensing system more secure.</li>
<li> Ported Unit tests from Boost Test Framework to Google Test Framework.</li>

</ul>
