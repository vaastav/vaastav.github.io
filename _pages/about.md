I am a grad student in the [Network, Systems, and Security Lab](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/nss/html/index.html){:target="\_blank"} at University of British Columbia where I work under [Prof. Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/){:target="\_blank"}.
I am currently doing a research intership at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/){:target="\_blank"} under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Mace](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~jcmace/){:target="\_blank"}.

I like building, testing, breaking and fixing software systems. My main areas of interest are Systems, and Software Engineering.
I also like to spend some time on Natural Language Processing and Data Visualization.

My hobbies include watching football, Formula 1, and learning new languages. 
I also like to cook in my free time and I do enjoy writing and reading poetry from time to time.

Here is my full academic [cv](/assets/files/cv.pdf){:target="\_blank"} and here is my [resume](/assets/files/resume.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.
