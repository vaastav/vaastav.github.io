I am currently on both the academic job market for a faculty position and on the industrial job market for a researcher position.
Here are the relevant documents:

I am a Doctoral Researcher at [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) where I work under the supervision of [Dr. Antoine Kaufmann](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~antoinek/) and [Dr. Deepak Garg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dg/). Previously, I was advised by [Herr. Dr. Jonathan Mace](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~jcmace/).

I like building, testing, breaking, and fixing software systems. My primary area of interest is Cloud Systems Reliability and Efficiency.

My hobbies include watching football, Formula 1, and learning new languages. 
I also like to cook in my free time and I do enjoy writing and reading poetry from time to time.

Previously, I was a M.Sc. student in the [Network, Systems, and Security Lab](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/nss/html/index.html){:target="\_blank"} at The University of British Columbia where I worked with [Dr. Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Margo Seltzer](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/).
