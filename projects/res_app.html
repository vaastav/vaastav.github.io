						The game basically requires the user to guess by clicking on the map where a randomly chosen restaurant is in the city with the ability to
						use upto a maximum of 3 hints.						
						<br><br>
						Done in pairs, this was our first step in the Android Development world.
						Although, we'd had some experience with using Java, we had never really made anything constructive like an Android app.
						With the User Interface already made and given to us by the course administrators, we had to implement the functionality of the application.
						The initial stages required us to write parsers for both the Google Maps data and the Yelp data.
						After this we had to work with the Google Maps API to place markers on the map where the user had clicked and to plot the total route between all
						such points. the learning curve was steep as we had to learn how to use nested classes and onClickListener classes to implement 
						the hints functionality as we wanted to show an arrow in the direction of the restaurant after clicking the marker.
						<br><br>
						In the end, it was a fun project which allowed us to learn the basics of software engineering and thus make progress in our software dev careers. 
						<br>
						A special thanks to my partner Seerat Sekhon. I couldn't have done it without her.
