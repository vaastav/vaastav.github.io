						<p class="lead"><b>This holds a very special place in my heart as it is my first ever project.
						Initially intended to be a fully graphical implementation of the game Monopoly World, it turned out to be a purely textual
						implementation of the game due to the restrictions of the graphics library of the C++ version I had to use.
						<br><br>
						It is a windows application which allows 6 players to play the game at the same time.
						The biggest challenge, in retrospect, I feel was to get the overall functionality of the game correct as I hadn't 
						been taught how a Class works and thus I had to use structs and enumerations instead to represent the players and the board.
						As I wanted to incorporate the complete characteristics of the board game in the program, I used rand and srand to replicated the rolling of the die
						and choosing Community Chest cards.
						<br><br>
						As it was the first project I ever made, this is when I realised that I wanted to develop software in my life. 
						This is what made me discover my passion and thus began my journey in becoming a computer programmer.
