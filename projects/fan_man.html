						<p class="lead"><b>This is a data scraper program that basically scrapes data using the fantasy premier league API about all the players who 
						have featured during the current English Premier League season.
						Developed for a fantasy manager league competition for the 2014-15 season that was run by a Facebook group 
						called The Quartet until the competition folded in December,2014.
						<br>
						Having been the first data scraper program I have ever made, the challenges were endless. I decided to use python as 
						I believed it provided a lot of resources for the intended purpose which I had learnt after watching the Google Python Class lectures on youtube
						provided by the Google Developers Channel. I used the urllib and urllib2 libraries to obtain the raw data from the url containing player list and 
						their respective points	and the re library to use the regular expression to find the all the players in the player list. A problem I faced initially was 
						that the player names had special characters which ASCII didn't have so I had to set the default encoding to UTF-8 which I did with the sys library.
						I finally used the csv library to read from and write the data in csv files.
						<br>
						This project made me realise how much I love data and thus led me to the decision that I wanted to specialise in big data.
