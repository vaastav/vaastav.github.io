				<p class="lead"><b>Just One Kool Esoteric Responder a.k.a JOKER is intended to be a futuristic AI with the ability to take commands from the user
				and perform designated tasks just like JARVIS from The Iron Man. The idea of such an AI originated during the Microsoft Kinect Hackathon on November 8, 2014.
				<br>
				From our team of 5 people, none of us had had any prior experience with either C# or the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor. 
				The challenge for all of us was to learn C# and how to use it to obtain and make sense of the data from the sensor within 24 hours.
				After reading a few tutorials about C#, we decided to use the SpeechBasics app provided from Microsoft as an example for developers to model our AI on.
				By this time, our time had divided into 2 groups, 1 which was working on developing the basic functionality of the AI and the other which was working on pong which 
				the user could play with the AI using hand gestures whilst making use of the gesture recognition functionality provided by the sensor.
				After setting up the basics of the data collection, we used the System library to provide us with the functionality we wanted. During this,
				we came across System.Speech.Synthesis which allowed us to make our AI talk.
				<br>
				Even though we didn't win the hackathon, we were delighted as to how much we had learned and progressed during those 24 hours.
				One day JOKER will definitely make it to the users(as soon as we get our hands on a Kinect sensor) and it will be the future.
				<br>
				A special thanks to my teammates Radu Nesiu, Jimmy Lin, Kyle Campbell and Raunak Kumar. I couldn't have done it without them.
